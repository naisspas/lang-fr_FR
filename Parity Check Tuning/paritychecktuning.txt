The Parity Problems Assistant is part of the Parity Check Tuning plugin=The **Parity Problems Assistant** is part of the **Parity Check Tuning** plugin=L'** Assistant des Problèmes de Parité** fait partie du plugin **Réglages de Vérification de Parité**

feedback is welcomed on the basic concept and ideas for improvement=Un retours d'expérience est souhaité à propos du concept et d'idées pour d'éventuelles améliorations
This assistant is intended to help pin down and resolve problems after a parity check has been run and errors have been reported=Cet assistant est conçu pour apporter de l'aide lorsqu'une opération de vérification en lecture / parité a signalé des problèmes 
The idea is that this assistant can be used after a parity check or read check has reported problems and logged the details of any problem sectors to the syslog=Le principe est que cet assistant peut-être utilisé après un signalement de problèmes lors d'une vérification en lecture / parité et que les détails de chaque erreur de secteurs aient été consignées dans le syslog
In many cases such errors can be due to external factors such as cabling or the power supply rather than the actual disks=Dans la plupart des cas de telles erreurs sont dues à des facteurs externes tels que des câbles ou une alimentation défectueuse plutôt que les disques eux-mêmes  
If you think you have rectified whatever caused the problems to occur then you can use this assistant to run a partial check over a narrow range to see if the problem still occurs=Si vous pensez que vous avez réparé la cause des erreurs vous pouvez utiliser cet assistant pour vérifier sur une petite étendue du disque si le problème est toujours présent
This can be much faster than having to run a full parity check or read check to see if you have resolved the issue or to run a disk extended SMART test to test the actual disk=Ceci peut-être beaucoup plus rapide qu'une vérification complète de la parité ou qu'un test SMART étendu sur le disque incriminé afin de vérifier une éventuelle résolution du problème

:parity_tune_explain_plug:
> The main purpose of this plugin is to allow you to limit array operations such as parity checks to running at times that will not inconvenience you.

>If you have set this to **No** then you get the default system behavior of parity checks running without a break to completion unless you manually stop/pause/cancel them.
>
>Setting this option to **Yes** specifies that parity checks should be run in increments spread over several days.
> As an example of what this plugin can do assume
>You have a parity check you have scheduled to start on the first of every month at midnight  
>* Your past experience has shown that if the parity check runs uninterrupted it takes 30 hours to complete.  
>* You set this plugin to use 3 hour increments starting at midnight and finishing at 3.00 A.M.  
>* The parity check will now actually take 10 days elapsed time (10 x 3 = 30) so the parity check will complete on 10th of the month.  
>* You have scheduled these increments to run starting at midnight and finishing at 3:00 A.M. when you know the system is not being used.  
>* You are not worried about this increased elapsed time and will welcome the increased system responsiveness during normal use.  
>* The rest of the month this plugin will do nothing as there is no active parity check in progress when the start time for an increment comes around.

:parity_tune_automatic_plug:
> if the unRaid system is not shutdown cleanly then the next time the array is started unRaid will automatically start a non-correcting parity check (or a read check if you have no parity disk). This can happen for a wide variety of reasons ranging from power loss; hardware issues; and software issus.  The automatic check is run because if there are any parity errors this can compromise the ability to recover from an array drive failure at a later date so you want to get back to having valid parity as soon as is practical.
> 
> If this option is set then the check will be allowed to run for a few minutes (as any errors after an unclean sheutdown are most likely to be at the start of the disks as they were not unmounted cleanly) and then automatically put the check into a paused state (if outside the time specified for running increments) and then the  remainder of the check subsequently run in increments according to the time slots specified for running increments.

:parity_tune_clear_plug:
> Should disk Clear operations be run using increments.<br><br>A disk Clear operation occurs when you add a new drive (that has not been pre-cleared (using the Pre-Clear plugin) to an array that is parity protected.  The Clear process writes zeroes to every sector on the new disk so that it can be added to the array without affecting the existing parity. Until the Clear operation has completed you are not able to format the disk in Unraid and start using it for storing data.
>
>Since until the Clear operation completes the disk will not be available for use it is likely that most people will want this option left at **No**.   In addition, a Clear operation tends not to put much of a load on the system so is less likely to impact performance in normal daily use.

To facilitate with debugging problems then in Testing mode you can log the messages to the flash drive either instead of the syslog or in addition to the syslog. The resulting parityTuning.log file will be stored in the plugin's folder on the flzsh drive and providing this file to the developer will help with diagnosing any unexpected behaviour you encounter.
